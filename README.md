## Data Preparation

### Source of Data

[Describe the source of your data. Is it a public dataset? Was it collected through surveys, sensors, etc.?]

### Data Cleaning

[Discuss the initial state of the data and what cleaning steps were performed. Mention handling of missing values, removal of duplicates, etc.]

### Data Transformation

[Did you have to transform the data in any way to make it suitable for analysis? Discuss any normalization or encoding steps.]

### Feature Engineering

[Describe any derived features you created and the rationale behind them.]

### Data Splitting

[Describe how you divided the data into training, validation, and test sets, and why you chose this method.]

## GitHub Versioning/Workflow

By adhering to the workflow discussed below, the project maintains a high level of code integrity, streamlines collaboration, and enables seamless tracking of project milestones.

### Branching Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Created an initial `develop` branch as the base for development.
2. **Feature Branches**: For each major stage of the project, a dedicated feature branch was created off of the `develop` branch.

### Commit and Merge Workflow

1. **Commit Changes**: After the completion of each stage, all changes were committed to the respective feature branch.
2. **Code Reviews and Merges**: The feature branch was then merged into the `develop` branch post-review.
3. **Creating New Feature Branches**: A new feature branch was created from the updated `develop` branch for the next stage of the project.
4. **Final Merge**: Upon completion of all stages, the `develop` branch was merged into the `main` branch through a pull request.

### Documentation

- Comprehensive comments were added at each stage for clarity and future reference.

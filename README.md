## GitHub Versioning/Workflow

By adhering to the workflow discussed below, the project maintains a high level of code integrity, streamlines collaboration, and enables seamless tracking of project milestones.

### Branching Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Created an initial `develop` branch as the base for development.
2. **Feature Branches**: For each major stage of the project, a dedicated feature branch was created off of the `develop` branch.

### Commit and Merge Workflow

1. **Commit Changes**: After the completion of each stage, all changes were committed to the respective feature branch.
2. **Code Reviews and Merges**: The feature branch was then merged into the `develop` branch post-review.
3. **Creating New Feature Branches**: A new feature branch was created from the updated `develop` branch for the next stage of the project.
4. **Final Merge**: Upon completion of all stages, the `develop` branch was merged into the `main` branch through a pull request.
